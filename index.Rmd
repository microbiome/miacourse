## Contents and learning goals

This course will teach the **basics of biomedical data analysis with
R/Bioconductor**, a popular open source environment for scientific
data analysis. The participants get an overview of the reproducible
data analysis workflow in modern multi-omics, with a focus on recent
examples from published microbiome studies. After the course you will
know how to approach new tasks in biomedical data analysis by
utilizing available documentation and R tools.

The teaching will follow open online documentation created by the
course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome
Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The openly licensed
teaching material will be available online during and after the
course, following national recommendations on open education.

The training material walks you through the standard steps of
biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis,
visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open
science.  We will teach generic data analytical skills that are
applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics
research. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the
student's learning speed.
