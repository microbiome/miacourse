In this course, we will analyze [HintikkaXOData](https://rdrr.io/github/microbiome/microbiomeDataSets/man/HintikkaXOData.html).
In this rat study, it was analyzed whether fats and prebiotics affects the microbiome. 

The data consist of 4 groups:

    - High-fat diet without prebiotics
    - High-fat diet with prebiotics
    - Low-fat diet without prebiotics
    - Low-fat diet with prebiotics

You can find the data from [here](https://github.com/microbiome/course_2022_oulu/tree/main/data).
